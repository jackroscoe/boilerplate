/**
 * Compass can auto generate sprites and sprite classes for you.
 *
 * If you expect to have a large number of sprites, you may want to consider grouping them into categories such as 'social', or 'thumbnails'.
 *
 * Sprite generation can be customised to add spacing around entire groups, or even individual icons if that's what you need. See this video for more information: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZHZPxIjiS8&hd=1
